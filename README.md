# TestZara

This test is done with Retrofit, Hilt, Lottie, Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture and MVVM architecture.

In the code, you can see different folders for separating the logic by applying the aforementioned architecture, with the view, the repository, the view model, and so on.

In the app when you see it, what can be seen is a change in the app icon showing a different one from the default, a loading that I took from the Lottie bookstore, the list of items with paging, and a search engine.

Steps:

1. Open the app and show the loading.
2. Information display with a search engine at the top.
3. Scroll until you reach the last part.
4. Shows loading since it is paginated and is going to show more information.
